## About Missenyi District

Missenyi District, located in the northwestern part of Tanzania, is one of the country's newer administrative divisions, with its capital at Bunazi. It belongs to the Kagera Region, which borders Uganda, Rwanda, and Lake Victoria, with Bukoba as its regional capital. The district lies approximately 60 kilometres from Bukoba town and remains largely rural, with an economy primarily driven by banana and coffee farming.

Missenyi's development has been hindered by historical challenges, including the 1978-79 Ugandan invasion under Idi Amin, which caused widespread destruction and displacement. Despite Tanzania reclaiming its land, the region never fully recovered due to inadequate post-war rehabilitation. The HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s further devastated families and communities, while crop and banana diseases like Mnyauko from the 1990s to the present exacerbated poverty. Today, Kagera remains one of Tanzania's poorest regions, facing limited access to education, healthcare, and markets.

## Current Challenges and Resilience

Missenyi's predominantly farming community faces recurring hardships, from extreme weather (droughts, floods) to natural disasters like the 2016 earthquake, which destroyed homes and infrastructure. Without robust government support or insurance systems, families rely on scarce resources to rebuild. Despite these struggles, the people of Missenyi demonstrate resilience, with agriculture sustaining 90% of livelihoods. However, systemic issues, historical neglect, crop failures, and health crises demand urgent intervention. Within this context, Tumaini Education Initiative, under the patronage of the Bukoba Catholic Diocese, is working to bridge educational gaps, empower communities, and support long-term recovery efforts.
