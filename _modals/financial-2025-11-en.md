### SECOND TERM 2025 - FINANCIAL REPORT

# TUMAINI EDUCATION INITIATIVE - 2025

Dear Benefactors and Benefactresses,

It is my sincere hope that this message finds you in good health and peace of heart. On behalf of the Tumaini Education Initiative, I would like to express our sincere gratitude for your generous commitment and tireless dedication. Your support — offered with both heart and soul — continues to make life more livable and meaningful for our schoolchildren.

The children themselves are profoundly grateful for your kindness. Their smiles and joy are living testimony to the hope you have rekindled in them. Our Diocesan Bishop, Rt. Rev. Jovitus Mwijage also extends his heartfelt appreciation. He personally authorised the recent withdrawal of funds used for this term's needs, ensuring that your donations are handled with integrity and transparency.

Our Tumaini Staff joins me in thanking you most sincerely, together with the children's parents, relatives, and teachers, as well as Fr. Nelius Rwiza, Parish Priest of Kassambya and an active member of the Tumaini Education Initiative WhatsApp group. Each one of them remains deeply grateful for your spirit of solidarity and compassion.

I am pleased to inform you that not all the funds sent have been spent. This is mainly due to variations in item costs and our careful follow-up on each child's needs to ensure the proper use and management of school materials. In some cases, we spent slightly less than anticipated; in others, a bit more, depending on individual circumstances.

For example, we initially expected to spend TZS 397,650 for Child F, who completed her primary education in September 2025. We have now enrolled her at Ishozi Sacred Heart Secondary School for Form One, where she will continue her academic journey. Including both her final primary and new secondary requirements, a total of TZS 445,000 was used to cover her school fees and necessities. We are confident that she will pass her national examination and begin Form One next year with great promise.

As for Child E, we decided to move her from a day school to a boarding school to give her a more conducive learning environment. Her parents were unable to provide sufficient time and space for her studies at home. For this reason, we purchased essential boarding items such as a mattress, blanket, and bed sheets.

We are deeply grateful to report that, through your continued generosity, the children's educational and personal needs are being met. They study without the burden of financial distress, and their confidence continues to grow. During our visits, we take time not only to speak with their teachers and parents but also to listen to the children themselves — to understand their challenges, encourage their dreams, and support them towards academic excellence.

Your kindness continues to change lives in quiet but profound ways. From all of us at Tumaini — the children, their families, the staff, and our Bishop — we say with full hearts: thank you, and may God abundantly bless you.

Finally, we want to assure you that what you are doing to help these children is truly remarkable and heartwarming. You may think you are changing the lives of only six children, but remember — by touching their lives today, you are also changing the lives of their children and grandchildren. You are truly transforming and saving generations.

The love you show is not just spoken but lived. Through your goodness and dedication, you are helping these children grow in confidence and hope. What you do is not only a beautiful act of humanity but also a genuine expression of Christian love in action.

Thank you, from the heart, for all the good you do.

Yours in Christ,

Fr. Salvius Kagugu,

TUMAINI Diocesan Coordinator.
