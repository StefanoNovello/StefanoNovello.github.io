# TUMAINI Education Initiative

## About Us {#about-en}

**"Tumaini" means "hope" in Swahili.** Our initiative supports children in remote rural areas of Tanzania who face financial barriers to education.

Founded in 2024 through a partnership between Fr. Nicolaus Matungwa Gomano and donors from Markt Schwaben Parish in Munich, we operate in the <a href="#" class="modal-link" data-modal="missenyi-en">Missenyi District</a> of Kagera, Tanzania.

## Status {#status-en}

March 2025

We have completed our first transfer of funds, and have been able identify and help 6 children who were not going to school because their families could not afford it. Each child has received school equipment, books, and clothes as well as having their school fees payed up to June 2025. The children are now going to various schools in the area.

We gathered 1000€ in donations of which 89% were spent directly for the children, the rest was used for expenses including transport and banking fees. [See Report](#){:.modal-link data-modal="financial-2025-3-en"}

In the meantime more children have been identified, and we are in the process of collecting more donations to continue helping the current children and to expand the program to others.
