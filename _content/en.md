## About Us {#about-en}

**"Tumaini" means "hope" in Swahili.** Our initiative supports children in remote rural areas of Tanzania who face financial barriers to education.

Founded in 2024 through a partnership between Fr. Nicolaus Matungwa Gomano and donors from Markt Schwaben Parish in Munich, we operate in the <a href="#" class="modal-link" data-modal="missenyi-en">Missenyi District</a> of Kagera, Tanzania.

We provide comprehensive educational support including:

* Community engagement

Our goal is to create sustainable change in these children's lives and provide them with tools for a better future.

### October 2025

### 🇬🇧 Project Update – Autumn 2025

Thanks to a **second round of generous donations**, we were able to cover the **school fees for all children for the remainder of 2025** and also respond to several **individual needs**:

- A mattress for a child who had been sleeping on the bare floor and often felt tired at school.  
- A bicycle for another child who had a very long walk to school every day.  
- Boarding accommodation for a child facing a very difficult family situation.  

All **six children we support** are now able to attend school regularly and are making good progress — a wonderful success for everyone involved!

In addition, our **network of supporters has grown**.  
In a separate effort in **Calabria, Italy**, a clothes collection was organized. Pilgrims traveling to Rome kindly carried the donations in their luggage to Tanzania — resulting in **over 120 kg of second-hand clothes** being distributed in a big weekend action that was warmly received. A financial donation also accompanied this initiative.  

We also held **workshops in two primary schools near Markt Schwaben**, where children learned what school life is like in Tanzania. We hope this will inspire further fundraising activities.  

Currently, we are **preparing for the Advent Concert** at *St. Margaret, Markt Schwaben* on **Sunday, November 30, 2025, at 6 p.m.**, where donations for the Tumaini Education Initiative will once again be collected.  
We are deeply grateful to everyone who contributes — your support truly changes lives!

### March 2025

We have completed our first transfer of funds, and have been able identify and help 6 children who were not going to school because their families could not afford it. Each child has received school equipment, books, and clothes as well as having their school fees payed up to June 2025. The children are now going to various schools in the area.

We gathered 1000€ in donations of which 89% were spent directly for the children, the rest was used for expenses including transport and banking fees. [See Report](#){:.modal-link data-modal="financial-2025-3-en"}

In the meantime more children have been identified, and we are in the process of collecting more donations to continue helping the current children and to expand the program to others.
